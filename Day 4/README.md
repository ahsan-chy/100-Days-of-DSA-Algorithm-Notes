## Auxilary Space 
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

**Note:** Itâ€™s necessary to mention that space complexity depends on a variety of things such as 
- the programming language, 
- the compiler, or 
- even the machine running the algorithm.






## In Place
An in-place sorting algorithm uses **constant space for producing the output (modifies the given array only).** It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list.

Many sorting algorithms rearrange arrays into sorted order In-place, including: 
-  bubble sort, 
-  selection sort, 
-  insertion sort, 
-  heapsort, and 
-  Shell sort. 
-  Quicksort operates in-place on the data to be sorted.

These algorithms require only a few pointers, so their space complexity is **O(log n).** 

An **in-place sorting** algorithm sorts the elements in place: that is, it needs only **`O(1) extra space.`** An **out-of-place sorting** algorithm needs extra space to put the elements in as it's sorting them. Usually this means **`O(n) extra space`**.

## Swap with **XOR** without Third Variable

[Reference Video Link](https://youtu.be/L7OeXaFrbmU)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
let x = 10, y = 5;

// Code to swap 'x' (1010) and 'y' (0101)

x = x ^ y; // x now becomes 15 (1111)
y = x ^ y; // y becomes 10 (1010)
x = x ^ y; // x becomes 5 (0101)

After Swapping: x =5, y=10
```
- **Time Complexity:** O(1).
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

**Example 2:**
```c++
arr[j] = arr[j] ^ arr[j+1];
arr[j+1] = arr[j] ^ arr[j+1];
arr[j] = arr[j] ^ arr[j + 1];
```
