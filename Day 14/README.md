## Linear Search 
Linear search is defined as a sequential search algorithm, that start from one End and goes through each element.

```c++
int linearsearch(int num[], int N, int x)
{
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++)
        {
            if(num[i] == x)
                return i;
        }
            return -1;
}
```
**Time Complexity**: O(N)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Binary Search 

Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by **repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.** The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to **O(log N)**. 

Conditions for when to apply Binary Search in a Data Structure:
- The data structure must be sorted.
- Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.

Pseudocode of Iterative  Binary Search Algorithm:

```c++
binarySearch(arr, x, low, high)
    repeat till low = high
           mid = (low + high)/2
           if (x = arr[mid])
               return mid
          else if (x > arr[mid])
               low = mid + 1
          else
               high = mid â€“ 1
```

##### Code
```c++
int binarysearch(int num[], int N, int x)
{
	int l = 0;
	int r = N-1;
	
	while (l <= r) {
		int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;

		// Check if x is present at mid
		if (arr[mid] == x)
			return mid;

		// If x greater, ignore left half
		if (arr[mid] < x)
			l = mid + 1;

		// If x is smaller, ignore right half
		else
			r = mid - 1;
	}

	// if we reach here, then element was not present
	return -1;
}

```

```c++
int even[] = {1,2,3,3,3,3,3,5};
int first = firstOccurance(even, 9, 3);
int last = lastOccurance(even, 9, 3);
```

##### Find total number of occurance of 3

```c++
